WEBSITE NOTES

(or, what a pain in the ass it is to setup/configure a website)

Most of the content is here:
	~/Proj-15/Jekyll/_site

Other content is here:
	/home/charlie/wwwroot/wwwroot/projects

	This is the content that isn't processed by Jekyll. I should move this to the Jekyll folder somehow . . . one day I will

Once you copy everything over to a new host, you need to install PHP5 to get the sanborn map .mbtiles to work
After that, you need to install the PHP5-sqlite extension, likely like so:
 apt-get install php5-sqlite

If that doesn't work, follow up here:

A complete archive of the website (well, at somepoint anyway) is available in /home/charlie/wwwroot/wwroot/.

Great. Never again.
