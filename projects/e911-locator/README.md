# E911Locator
Mapping app to help locate/determine an E911 physical address

Live demo: www.mappingvermont.org/projects/e911

Users can enter a town name, then an address to be taken to their physical address, or can pan and zoom to their house if unsure of their "official" state-issued address.

Originally designed over frustration with voter registration and districts in Vermont. Can't everyone just know their E911 address? Mailing addresses are the worst. Zip code data is the worst. Point data is the best-- we can aggregate up to any geography. Largely a proof of concept to show that it's easy to show someone their E911 address.

E911 data is from [VCGI](http://vcgi.vermont.gov/) and is probably already out of date. H/T to [Chris Essig](https://csessig.wordpress.com/) for a great [application template](https://github.com/csessig86/tabletop_to_leaflet).
